# Git Janitor (bash)
Bulk update all your local git repos from different directories even if they require sudo

## Repos with elevated permissions 
If you have repos in folders that require sudo, add a *true* after the directory name just like my 1st example, it'll ask for sudo pass

### Configuration
You should change the repo_directories to match yours
